# SEAbot

Hello, I am a bot used for various meaningless tasks on the /r/Seattle discord server.

This is a hobbyist project and nobody should ever in their right mind take a dependency on any code or configurations found within.

If you find a bug or have an idea for an improvement or a new feature - please create an issue!
